0,1309478520,AskReddit,"I got mine out a few years back. The main thing I remember immediately following the experience is being really woozy from the anesthesia. I felt like I could kinda function, but I was pretty wrong. Parents driving me home, decided to stop for jamba juice or something b/c they thought it might be good (and it was) but upon getting home I knocked it over b/c I just didn't have the hand/eye coordination to pick it up off of the kitchen table. So ya, watch out for stuff like that, it can be annoying when you first get home. Anyway, after that I think i went to take a nap and when I woke up it was all good.

The most important thing I can say is to make sure you are on top of keeping the sockets clean until they heal. It is quite important, and you wouldn't want to end up needing to have more crap done to your mouth b/c you didn't take proper care.

Honestly the pain wasn't bad at all, and I think a lot of people (maybe those with a super low threshold) over hype it. They gave me a big bottle of painkillers after the surgery, but I never felt the need for one (although tbh I'd much rather deal with a little pain than take pills for it, I'm much more afraid of the painkillers).",,,0

For foreign travel, the only land borders we have are with Mexico and Canada and I feel like you might be able to get away with just a drivers license for that, although I have no idea of that's true or not.

320,1402274520,asoiaf,"&gt; Do you think that GRRM will let the show creators dictate to him how the books should end? Don't be ridiculous, no one would benefit from that. He's just going to do his own thing.

Obviously they're not going to sit him down and tell him how the series should be ended. But he's working with them and telling them where the series is going so that they can continue to make a mostly faithful adaptation as they go into territory that hasn't been charted by the books.

Bottom line is that HBO gets to finish the story first. They get to tell their version of the ending to George's story and that's the first glimpse anyone anywhere is going to get to the resolution of this series. Even after the book comes out, it will kinda be framed by what people saw in the show. All the major reveals will already be spoiled. There will be some minor plot lines that the show may not have tied up, but the bulk of the story will already be told.

Sure, GRRM gets to say X, Y, and Z die and A and B win the series. After that, though, the execution is on HBO. They have artistic license to decide how certain scenes are depicted and play out. So how well they do their jobs is going to have a direct impact on how we perceive the closing of the series, and I'd say that, to a degree, makes ASOIAF their series.

&gt;I also don't see why anyone should care how the general public - who don't even read books - will remember the story. It has no bearing on our enjoyment of the series.

True, how people remember the series doesn't have much bearing on our enjoyment. I just thought it was kinda sad that GRRM doesn't get to be the first person to wrap up this story he's been telling for almost 20 years now. 

What does have a bearing on our enjoyment is that people will feel forced to watch the show before they read the books, just to avoid having things spoiled. Personally, I think it's a bummer that with a book series I've been following for over a decade, I'm now going to have to watch a crappy show ending version of the conclusion because I don't think it will be possible to exist on the internet and avoid spoilers for the multiple years I'd need to wait for the books to come out.

So now I'm stuck watching HBO's series, because if I just wait for the books there's always the chance that some random person will just blurt out a major plot point or that some big event will become a popular meme/catchphrase (e.g. Aeris dies, soylent green is people, etc.). And I think a lot of book readers who aren't super into the show find themselves in that same position. It's just not a great place to be.",,,0

Display back is much harder because you're critiquing the movement and its finishing. There are a lot of truly beautiful movements, especially as you climb in price.

I dig the design of GO rotors and their movements generally look pretty nice. On an auto, a good looking rotor is nice given the amount of real estate the rotor will take up, even with skeletonized rotors.

I also agree with the poster that mentioned benzinger; the 3/4 rose skeleton is a favorite of mine (since I like the watch from any side), but his movements all look pretty good to me.
