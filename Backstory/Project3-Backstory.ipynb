    "Given a specific user, find out more about them: where they’re from, what things they like/dislike, and other data about their background (think of at least 2 more things to determine). Note that this should be somewhat automated; I should be able to give you a username and you’ll produce a backstory dataset for them (it may work better with some users than others). Provide a three sample user backstories in your report, written up as a narrative."
