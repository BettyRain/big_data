1,1420138593,cocktails,"It's very sweet with a mild elderflower taste. I make a drink for my girlfriend with cranberry juice, St. Germain, lime, and a vodka infusion that I make. It tastes like flowers from the garden of Eden. I also use it in my tarted up version of a gimlet. The floral notes from the St. Germain really accentuate a quality gin and the sweetness means that I don't have to add any sugar to cut through the tartness of fresh lime. You can try using it to replace simple syrup in a whole slew of recipes and see how you feel about them.",,,0

3,1410560598,bartenders,"No problem. First, I'd consider what you're looking for from this job. Is it something that you're interested in for a long term commitment or just some quick cash? If all you want is some extra cash in your spare time, you'll probably be looking in different places than if you're in it for months or years. There are plenty of places in my area that will hire you straight on to bartend. While they'll pay off in the short term it's likely that there's a reason they have such high turnover; places that hire bartenders are doing it because they can't hold on to their bartenders.


I wouldn't worry about a lack of experience. Unless you're applying for a very high level position, most places are perfectly willing to pick people off of the street, as long as they like the look of you. Personally, I would rather train someone who's never mixed a drink in their life than a person who's learned from some half-assed drink slinger. Be willing to start at the bottom and get your hands dirty doing some thankless (and possibly disgusting) work. You'll be rewarded for it.


As a corollary, don't waste your money on bartending school. This isn't universally agreed upon, but it's my view and the view of everyone I know in the service industry. Not every such school is a sham, but most of them want to take your money and teach you only the most basic techniques (and often they're wrong). If you really want to learn about making drinks, find a really good bartender and buy drinks from them. Ask what they're doing and why they're doing it. Monday nights at my bar are a great time for doing this. It's slow enough that we can afford to spend time making awesome cocktails and we have plenty of time to answer any questions you can come up with. It's cheaper and more informative than bartending school, plus you get to get drunk while you do it!


The next thing I'd consider is if you can hack the hours. The number one reason people quit at my bar is they don't realize how rough the hours are. The bartending schedule can be brutal if you're planning on having a life during the day. There are certainly places that close at 'normal people' hours, but many of them (at least in my experience) will have you leaving work at three or four o'clock in the morning. I, for instance, am typing this as I watch the sun come up. 


If you've decided that you can hang with the hours and you've decided that the service life is one for you, the next step is to find a place that suits your individuality. Would you be happier in the club scene where you're dealing with high volumes and loud music every night or would you prefer something like a pub where you spend much more time interacting with your customers? Where do you like to go in your spare time? I was a regular at my bar well before I ever thought of transitioning to the service industry; a big part of the reason I'm so happy to go to work every day is that I fell in love with my workplace well before they ever started paying me. That said, when I decided to quit my last job I applied at a dozen different places and I was just lucky to get an offer from my first choice. 


So you've decided working crazy hours is good and you've found places you think you'll be happy? Now you need to get hired. My bar has an application form that everyone fills out; a CV or resume isn't necessary. That doesn't mean it doesn't help. This, of course, varies wildly. If you're looking at a more upscale venue, they'll probably want some sort of paper document from you. At some places the hiring process is as simple as showing up and talking to the owner. Figure out what they're expecting from you and give it to them. No matter what, I'd have some sort of CV or resume ready before I walk in the door. They may not need it, but it certainly won't hurt. [Here's](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2006/how-to-write-a-bartending-resume/) a second link to the same page I recommended before. It works for Clyde Commons, which is an upscale restaurant, and it'll work for the nastiest dive bar you'll ever set foot in. Protip: if you can fit it on one page, so much the better. I'd rather leave a prospective interviewer wanting to ask followup questions than bog them down in mindless detail.


When it comes time to deliver your application/resume, it's best to do it at a time when the bar is quiet. DO NOT SHOW UP AT MIDNIGHT EXPECTING PEOPLE TO TALK TO YOU! If you do, your hard work is going straight into the trash. I tell every single person that asks for an application to deliver it right when we open. This has a couple of advantages for the prospective applicant. Managers are usually there an hour or two before business begins, so you get to hand your application directly to the person who is going to hire you. This makes you an actual person in their minds, rather than some anonymous piece of paper. You can find out if they're hiring at the moment, or when they expect to. You can make sure that you fit what they're looking for, and if you're lucky they might just decide to hire you on the spot.


Don't worry if you don't get called back from your first few interviews. Interviewing is a skill just like any other. No one goes to their first interview and knocks it out of the park. If you get hired immediately, great. If you don't get hired, keep on trying. Eventually you'll find somewhere that will pick you up. 


Bartending is a great way to make a living, whether it's as a summer job or for years to come. You meet all kinds of people you'd never encounter otherwise, every single day is something new, and your entire raison d'etre is making people happy. It's constantly challenging and always changing. I guarantee you'll end up with stories that you'll remember for a lifetime, and possibly some that you don't remember at all. It's a rewarding path, and one that I recommend to anyone that's interested. I hope I've been able to shed some light on this for you, let me know how it goes for you and I'll be happy to give you any help that I can along the way.

1. A person must have a reasonable fear of immediate physical harm and

2. Have a reasonable belief that immediate use of force is necessary to prevent that harm and

3. Not use more force than is reasonable/necessary to stop the threat.

177,1451239192,bartenders,"I feel like every time this question gets asked the first (and only) advice that gets posted is to quit. I'm not always sure that's right, so here's a counterpoint.

Working new bars is a double-edged sword. Things are crazy and hectic and disorganized and no one really knows what their responsibilities are. People quit left and right, and there's a decent chance that the whole thing will fizzle out and go bust. It's going to be stressful and sometimes you'll want to strangle everyone you work with. This is to be expected.

If you can handle the stress, though, it is not without its advantages. Things will stabilize eventually, as the owners and managers figure out what works. Remember that no one, not even the owner, has had a chance to field test their ideas before they go into practice. Everyone thinks they have a good idea of what's going to happen until it comes time to actually do it. This is likely why your tipout has been changing, not because they're being shady but because the owners need to make sure that everyone is compensated commensurately with their value. 

Also, remember that part from the first paragraph about people dropping like flies? It turns out that can benefit you. If a bunch of the OG bartenders can't hack it, then those shifts still need to get covered. Who is going to be covering them? Probably you, if you can show you're ready. And if you do well tending bar and interacting with your colleagues you can get bumped up to management very quickly. And it's always nice to be one of the OGs.

In summation, no one here can know all the details of your situation, and that makes it hard for us to give you accurate advice. If you have problems make sure to address them with management before you decide to up and quit. It may be that they're receptive to what you have to say and are willing to work to fix your issues. That said, it may also be that this isn't the place for you and it's time to leave. Only you can make that decision for yourself. Whatever happens, though, we're all pulling for you.",,,0

213,1478154515,foodhacks,"The safe temp for beef is not 160F. Rare is generally between 125F and 135F. Medium rare is 130-140F, etc. 160F is past well done. A 160F steak is going to be tough, stringy, and not particularly flavorful. Basically it's bad.

Cooking ground beef to 160F, however, is perfectly fine for two reasons. First, grinding the beef destroys all the muscle fibers that would otherwise tighten up and make your beef dry, and also because of bacterial/food safety concerns.

The bacteria that cause food-borne illness in beef can only live on the surface of the meat. They cannot penetrate into the center of the cut. Once the beef is ground, however, that surface bacteria can survive throughout the beef, necessitating a higher internal temperature for the food to be considered ""safe"".

Using conventional cooking methods, if you cook a whole muscle cut (like a steak) to 135F internally then the surface temperature is much higher (closer to 160F and up) because a good sear requires high temperature. This is fine because the bacteria that cause food-borne illness tend to live on the surface of meat. Internally we're really only concerned about parasites, and those die at much lower temperatures. Unless your meat has been cut apart and then glued back together, in which case it's possible for those scary bacteria to colonize the inside of the meat.",,,0

Learning to cook helped me lose a lot of weight without changing my lifestyle too much. It means that you know exactly what's going on your plate and makes portion control easier.  [The Food Lab](http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab) is a great series that explains how and why to use different techniques to make meals, some healthy, some less so.

Upping your vegetable intake means you can eat a lot of matter without consuming a huge amount of calories, which does a good job of making you feel more satiated. Protein is good for keeping you full for long periods of time, but processed meats like sausage tend to have excessively high fat content.

Another important thing is that your brain doesn't register liquids as containing calories, which is why so many diets recommend avoiding alcohol and soda.

I've never bothered with counting calories and calculating macros. Not that it doesn't work, it's just more effort than I'm willing to put in. I've found that a little bit of self-restraint/common sense does a good enough job for my purposes.

Since I never really went on a ""diet"" I lost weight somewhat slowly, but I've dropped about 50 pounds over three years or so. I haven't really yo-yoed at all, and I think that's because I decided to change my lifestyle rather than going on a crash diet that I would have abandoned rather soon.

311,1450869178,legaladvice,"Yes. For any number of reasons. Pick your favorite.

It's not at all uncommon for people (particularly those with mental illness or disability) to confess to crimes they haven't committed. A high profile murder case might draw half a dozen or more confessions. If one of these false confessors ends is charged then it falls to the defense attorney to exonerate the client, even if the client has an honest belief that they committed the offense.

Alternatively, if an attorney had to drop a client they knew to be guilty then it would either force clients to lie to their attorneys or create a situation in which the government could essentially run roughshod over the rights of the accused in the courtroom. Most defendants don't have legal backgrounds, so they wouldn't be able to effectively force the prosecution to prove its case.

Additionally, if a client says one thing in consultation and another in the courtroom, then who is to say which is the lie? It's entirely possible that the client was lying in consultation, and it's the attorney's job at that point to advocate for the facts that point to innocence, which in this case would be to argue that what the client said on the stand is true.

Lastly, it's prejudicial. If lawyers can't represent guilty people, then anyone without a lawyer is perceived as guilty, since they can't get a lawyer.

I'm sure there are a bunch of others that I've forgotten, as well. At any rate the takeaway is yes, even guilty people deserve representation, and not giving them that harms everyone.",,,0

365,1480388986,Whatcouldgowrong,"To clarify the others' comments, the way you use a static tow strap (one that doesn't have much/any stretch, like the one in OP's video) is to back up gently until the rope is taught then use a low-range gearing and lots of torque to pull a vehicle out slowly. The dynamic (rubber band-type) method is to get a bit of a head start and let the tow vehicle's momentum transfer to the stuck vehicle.

Using a static tow rope with a moving start is like bungee jumping with a noose. You get to the bottom and instead of stretching and cushioning your fall you hit the end of the line and everything jerks to an immediate halt. Not good for people, not good for vehicles.",,,0

 - Pants sit way too high. Belts are often cinched at or above the belly button. [Not cool, guys.](http://goinglikesixty.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/old_man_high_pants-257x300.jpg)

 - Correspondingly, ties are way too short. Historically, men's ties tend to end around the top of the pants. When your trousers rise above the navel that means the tie ends somewhere around your sternum.

 - Modern jackets are cut differently. The 1920's really popularized the ""American cut"" suit, which was cut straight down the sides and very, very baggy. This is comfortable if you have to wear the suit for fourteen hours a day, but it would never be called stylish. Also, suit jackets tended to be very long, ending at or around the bottom of the butt. Some modern jackets are that long, but were I recommending a suit to someone I would say to get it just a hair shorter, ending around the lower third of the butt (church butt, if you will).

 - I'm bored now, So I'll do the rest of this quickly. Their pants are straight legged rather than tapered to fit the body, hemlines tended to favor a full break rather than a quarter or no break (these guys notwithstanding), and a myriad of other issues.

TL;DR: Sure, we're wearing the same pieces: trousers, jacket, shirt, and tie. How those pieces look changes constantly. Everything you need to know can pretty much be summed up in [this picture of the 2003 NBA draft class](http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/history/draft/2003-draft/2003-draft-608.jpg).
