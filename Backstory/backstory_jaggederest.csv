Each bit of the process should do as little as possible, individually, and coordinate through your queue. For video encoding, I would have a cron process that spawns a daemon that checks the queue, pulls one message, processes it, puts an update back on the queue, and dies.

I'm doing it with Ruby, but there's no real difference with the high-level process. RabbitMQ makes it really easy to add another node if your encoding gets overloaded.

126,1324597886,AdvancedFitness,"Pain was pretty negligible, a nice side effect of the nerve effects. You can definitely feel that your jaw is broken though. I would say it was comparable to having my wisdom teeth removed - the same surgeon did that, and there was approximately the same amount of pain.

They also put me on a really nice liquid pain medication after surgery - heroin in a bottle, heh. I remember laying on my bed making snow angels in the covers and thinking 'man I have a broken jaw but... whee!'. You'll be drinking everything through a syringe for the first little bit. You may be hospitalized, the lower jaw I think requires a couple days.

It took me at least a couple weeks until I could talk at all, and the full 6 weeks before I could talk any substantial amount. I returned to work after three or so weeks, in tech support, and ended up taking a pad and pencil with me everywhere so I could 'talk' to people.

Another thing they may or may not discuss is oral hygiene. Bottom line is, you really can't achieve any reasonable oral hygiene with your jaw held shut. They gave me a mouth wash, which helped with the experience, but your breath is going to be pretty halitosis for a while. I started wishing there was a sign around my neck 'my bad breath is due to surgery, please don't be offended'.

I'd also recommend you keep a journal of the process, starting about a month before hand, and write down what the doc says, and after surgery have someone write in it for you, like how much medication on what day at what time, how your pain is, food consumption. It helped me to remember what was going on when I had some pain medication in my system.

All in all, being where I am now, I have to say it's definitely something I would have done again in a heartbeat. The level of functional change was huge, and a nice side effect was it made me more attractive. If they're advancing your jaw, that'll probably happen to you, too, so talk to your doc about the cosmetic aspect - no reason not to have them fix it while they're in there.",,,0

There are lots of non-mechanizable ways of making 'better cups of coffee', though proper espresso is close to the best.

You don't see them because the cost/reward ratio is not worth it - if it costs twice as much as espresso but is only 20% better, it still fails in the market. Ditto with the best beans - you can buy them for $25 a pound, but they're only 10% better than the $13 a pound beans, maybe.

That's why Starbucks is so dominant. I personally don't like their coffee at all, it's very roast-dominant and tastes burned to me, but they've got a system set up, and what they sell is the complicated drinks not the espresso itself.

373,1292632215,energy,"I used to work in a fab. I'm not sure what their environment is like, but fabs in general are difficult places to work.

Depending on the clean room level, you may be in a full body suit. That alone eliminates about 30% of the people who would work there, because they just can't stand the full body covering (jumpsuit, booties, two gloves, hood, mask).

Another part is, the fab is pretty fast-paced. Lots of walking around - we used to joke that we clocked at least 10 miles a shift. Your knees are just *gone* at the end of the night.

Another factor is that they generally work compressed weeks - four shifts, 12 hour days, 4 days a week on, 3 days a week off, 3 days on, 4 days off. After one of those 12 hour days, you don't have any energy at all - shower and sleep and get up the next day.

Finally, the kind of job itself - frequently you need warm bodies with a highschool education. It's difficult to find people who have any school experience, so no point in hiring people with college degrees unless they're in EE and can actually be process engineers, things like that.

So the turnover rate is high because some of the workers will just be 'deadbeats' for lack of a better term.

564,1333964096,Fitness,"&gt; I AM A.. I am a kinesiology major and what I've come to know about metabolism is it, and several other functions we all exhibit, constitute an interrelated system according to what precisely what goes on in the other functions. 
&gt;
&gt; What occurs in each of the following systems dictate one another; Sleep (or lack there of), exercise (or lack there of), diet (cumulative intake of foods), and metabolism. I've asked some physiologists about the myth of 'I can eat whatever I want, when I want, as long as I work it off'.  
&gt;
&gt; Surely, if you ate a donut and went for a run, yes, things of that nature are fine, however, if you replenished the body with another donut, from a nutritional standpoint, is quite pointless.  
&gt;
&gt; I view the human body as an immense and hypothetical balance in that the mentioned functions above all influence one another.  
&gt;
&gt; For example, if you're getting inadequate sleep, you can bet your metabolism will come up short as well.  
&gt;
&gt; Anyhow, losing muscle and gaining weight will not work, simultaneously. Losing your excess lipids, stored conveniently upon your stomach, entails your exercise increasing in intensity, and assuming you'd 'indulge' into a caloric deficit, which o'er time (dependent how much fat you have to loose) it would surely disappear. 
&gt;
&gt;  Gaining weight is the antithesis of fat; mind you, your body needs a certain amount of lipids to maintain lubrication in arteries and joints.  
&gt;
&gt; I am a firm believer that the body is also an equation, that is: Input=Output. What is internal is reflected externally, so, if you're consuming an excess amount of fats and calories without exercise, you can bet those excess fats and calories will show up somewhere on your body.  
&gt;
&gt; However, those who consume adequate lipids and calories (and of course, enough proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water) would experience a future with a more appealing physique than that of our couch potato.  
&gt;
&gt; So, if you truly wish to change your physique (losing, gaining, or maintaining your weight), I would recommend you begin immediately, evaluate what you're eating (foods or lack there of), activities (or lack there of), how much you're sleeping (or not), establish a fitness goal (of losing, gaining, or maintaining weight), and finally, reevaluate your lifestyle.  
&gt;
&gt; Make decisions in the mindset of long term goals (ex. if I drink a soda today, and tomorrow, and the next, this is more likely a regressive diet habit). Remember the balance of functions (sleep, activity, diet, and metabolism)?  
&gt;
&gt; Adjust that balance to proper parameters to accommodate your fitness goal and don't give up.

That is also one of the reasons that plantar warts on the feet are common in people who wander around the gym barefoot:

&gt; Because plantar warts are incubated by shoes and spread by contact with moist walking surfaces, they can be prevented by remaining barefoot after walking in public areas such as showers or communal changing rooms until the feet have had time to dry and wear off the virus, or by wearing flip flops or sandals, not sharing shoes and socks, and avoiding direct contact with warts on other parts of the body or on other people.

956,1437677822,todayilearned,"Point by point:

&gt;Sorry, but it does not make any sense. If a structure is designed to be entirely in compression then it will be entirely in compression regardless of the material (assuming similar self-weight). The material does not have anything to do with it - in theory, you could make the same thing out of steel, concrete etc.

Yes, but we don't actually build structures that are in compression any more. If you ask an engineer to evaluate the Colosseum, for example, they'll tell you it should fall down because it doesn't have steel bracing, even though it's very evidently stable over millenia. (they've been having to fight people demanding to 'make it safe' by adding steel reinforcement for a while now)

&gt; Also, how is material strength not a problem? Imagine you make a 0.2m x 0.2m column out of masonry - then put a huge weight on it - you don't think it will crumble? Masonry just like any other material has a compressive strength limit and it is much lower than concrete, not even talking about steel.

When you build a building in the modern way, you use a safety factor of sometimes 10x. Masonry buildings under compression often exceed that by 100x. It's not about the actual material properties, it's about the fact that you stack them correctly and they have enormous overcapacity, vs a modern reinforced concrete bridge (for example) that is under tension in places, and thus simply cannot have 100x safety capacity unless you're building it from unobtanium (carbon nanotube fiber or the like)

&gt; As for models - not sure what you are talking about, but nowadays everything is calculated using accurate computer models anyway. If you can make a scaled down model from masonry, you sure as hell can do it with other materials. I just don't see the point.

The point is that, with primitive techniques (a literal scale model made from the same materials) you can build safe buildings. If you built a tiny scale model of steel and concrete in the modern style, and then tried to scale it up, the materials couldn't handle the stresses due to the square-cube law increase in stress. This is all based on the fact that masonry buildings don't have to worry about material strength, so when you double the size and octuple the stresses, they're still well within limits.

&gt; Just because steel and concrete is used closer to their strength limits does not mean that the materials are to blame, they are much better structurally than masonry. They are used closer to their strength limits because people want to (gasp!) save money. This is the same reason masonry is used - simply it is easier to build and it is cheap, not because it's some magic material where you ignore the compressive limits etc.

That's precisely the point though, they're not used closer to their stress limits because people want to save money, but because the techniques to build (for example) dry spanned masonry domes simply don't exist any more. If you try to put that sort of thing into an engineering analysis program, it'll tell you it should fall down, even though the Duomo has been standing for ~1000 years.",,,0

The problem is that this cannot happen when a country is borrowing in a sovereign currency, so the EU as a whole has to own up and help instead.

The phosphate forms a very thin coating on interior pipe surfaces to keep lead from dissolving into water. Many other water utilities across the U.S. are taking similar measures. The phosphate is added in the form of phosphoric acid (70 percent H3PO4). Starting in early September 1996, the level will be 3 parts per million (ppm) phosphate. The Water Works anticipates that lead levels will drop below the maximum allowed limit after 1 year, and they hope to subsequently reduce the phosphate dose to 1 ppm (as PO4).

Then there's no way to really measure it.

Price vs median income is a decent one, though, I'll grant you that. It's still pretty subjective though.

&gt; There's nothing wrong with price deflation from increased productivity. We've had it in the tech industry for years, and it's been a tremendous boon. The bad kind of deflation is monetary deflation - ie when the money supply shrinks due to a credit contraction. But a massive credit contraction would never happen if the money supply wasn't inflated in the first place via fractional reserve banking.

I don't think you understand this: When productivity increases nation or worldwide, there must be a corresponding increase in the money supply.

Take the case of a small country, such as South Korea. Around the end of the Korean war, say 1955, they were most definitely an undeveloped nation. By 1960, standard of living had increased drastically. By 1980, they were a developed nation with a large GDP per capita.

Without an adequate increase in money supply, this kind of growth is simply not possible. Every person ends up with one dollar, and wouldn't give it away to save their life. Similarly, a country which has entered a profound decrease in GDP per capita will find itself spiralling downward with stagflation, assuming it's formerly large economy had the money supply it needed. Cf. russian rubles and people carting money in wheelbarrows to buy bread.

These are not mere price bubbles or fluctuations, they are long-term increases and decreases in the general need for trade. And I'm still leaving aside the changing requirements of longer distance trades, and the decreasing requirements of faster trading with the advent of computers.",,,0

So in theory I should be able to focus on twice as wide a section and still achieve 'typical' acuity.

For example, when I wear contacts, I easily read the 20/10 line on the chart, but 'adequate correction' on my normal glasses is 20/20 or so.

So the major limit, to my mind, is the inability of my eyes to pull information out of the background, since details at 20/10 acuity are hard to see, even when it is technically possible.

What I'd like to see is as follows: the fovea expanded to cover 10 degrees, and the inside section given a much larger view. Sort of a toroidal expansion of the edge, and a contraction of the center, so that one might be able to read accurately at a distance, and yet accurately see a wider area.

That class was responsible for more business-engineering hookups than any other class I've been in. Every engineer there got laid by one of the 95 businesswomen-in-training who could not handle pointer math.

The class was just after lunch, and had been thinned down to ~80-90 people by the end of the term.

from 5 to 12 L/d. The Water Consumption Planning Factors study report
(also known as the Potable Water Planning Guide), published by the
US Army Combined Arms Support Command, recommends that each
soldier be provided with 11.4 L of water per day (ie, intake for each
soldier should be no more than 11.4 L of water per day). Therefore,
in an established battlefield situation in which water supply is achieved,
sufficient water should be available to sustain the water balance of each

As diffusion is slower than the half-life of the molecule, it will react with any oxidizable compound in its vicinity. **It can damage virtually all types of macromolecules**: carbohydrates, nucleic acids (mutations), lipids (lipid peroxidation) and amino acids (e.g. conversion of Phe to m-Tyrosine and o-Tyrosine).

And yet the system is in production to this day doing payroll for all 9000 of the Chrysler workers in DaimlerBenz.

&gt; You know, statements like that are like a neon sign over the top of the thing you're describing saying ""Fraud"".

How does saying ""Someone who does not understand (a concept) has not tried to understand (a concept)"" equate to fraud? I did not say that ""people who do not _love_ pair programming have clearly never tried it"", I essentially said 'If you haven't seriously tried it, you're not qualified to have an opinion'.

&gt; Good flexitime arrangements etc.

Yes, this is true. I've never worked in a pair programming shop where people did not work flex time. You simply work with each other to be in the office together sometimes, and that's when you pair up. The other times you can work on tests, work on prototypes, work on tools, try out new technologies, document bugs, any of the dozen or so other things that make up the average programmer's day.

&gt; Most software development is donkey work, which is done somewhat on auto-pilot. Moreover, decent peer review of documents and code is known to be very effective at finding any flaws that do creep into the routine work, and finding them early.

I submit to you that pair programming is orthogonal to code reviews. Depending on the level of correctness needed, both should be used. Ideally, a developer who was not a part of the pair that wrote the code will review it, or even _two_ unrelated developers.

The fact is that pair programming is not just about correctness. It's about having someone thinking long term while you're thinking short term, and having another brain to keep you moving when you get stumped. It's about curing 'code block' once and for all. It's about joking and talking with another human.

1546,1253861575,Frugal,"JasonDJ has it correct. Gold and silver are not an effective store of savings, despite what the gold bugs might tell you.

Also, you don't understand what I mean when I say investment. Investing is a term with a very specific meaning. Savings are not investment.

By your standards, putting money into Euros would be investment. What you are describing is merely changing the value store that holds your money. This is all well and good, but it is saving, not investment.

Stocks and bonds, on the other hand, are actually investment, since they provide a return. Stocks typically provide a return based on growth or dividends. If you find that too risky (which you apparently do), bonds provide a fixed income which you may find more palatable. If the loss of value of the dollar is your primary concern, there are TIPS, which are inflation protected.

In a more formal sense, stocks are not really investment either. Investment is the expenditure of capital to produce returns in the future. An example would be a company purchasing manufacturing equipment. In this sense, bonds *can* be investment, depending on what they are funding. Stock can, as well, at an offering by the company. Buying stock on the open market is not investment.",,,0

When it's time to do a push, you have someone with the proper privileges pull, then push the code. Their local machine has complete repository capabilities, so there's no need for them to push, ever. Or you set up feeder repos, or clone, or have tiered repos.

1704,1227382724,AskReddit,"I live in a city with a relatively large suburban area, though it is constrained by a river to the north. (Portland, OR)

We have light rail, and they're putting in more as fast as they can. It's on schedule to go right by my house within the next five years.

By no means is it an efficient system, given that it costs a whole assload of money, but it is very _effective_, which is all I care about. 

There are places in the 200+ blocks that can use the transit system here to get all the way to the 200+ blocks on the other side of the city. Takes about an hour, but driving is much slower than that.

There's also a commuter heavy rail system in place, running between two cities that are connected by a roundabout freeway and a rural area. There's no really direct way to do the hour-plus drive, so taking a 30min train ride sounds like a bargain.

While we do have some unique features about our city, it's a model that can work for other places: buses act as feeders into the light rail system, which is the heavy-lifting for the major destinations.",,,0
